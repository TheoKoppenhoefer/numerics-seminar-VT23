# numerics-seminar-VT23
Repository for the numerics seminar NUMN27 in Lund, VT23. The assigned project was the paper “Globally convergent type-I Anderson acceleration for nonsmooth fixed-point iterations,” by J. Zhang, B. O’Donoghue, and S. Boyd. It includes a project presentation, an implementation and a project report. Note that this is still work in progress.

## TODO
- go into convergence rates, newton method
- write proper introduction
- write out summary
- write out modifications
- suss out spacing of figures
- refer to lines in algorithms
- final checks: spell check, tex clean up
- comment on code

- check out prerequisites, general report writing
